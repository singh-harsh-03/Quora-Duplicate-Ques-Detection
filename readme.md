# Quora Duplicate Question Detection

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that detects duplicate questions on Quora. The goal is to identify pairs of questions that have the same intent but are phrased differently. This project utilizes feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in predicting duplicate questions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features such as common words, total words, and question lengths.
- **Model Training**: Implemented and compared multiple models including Naive Bayes and Random Forest.
- **Performance Improvement**: Enhanced model accuracy from 54% to 99% using extensive feature engineering.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- CountVectorizer
- Random Forest Classifier

## Results

- Achieved **54% accuracy** using Naive Bayes as the baseline model.
- Improved to **74% accuracy** with Random Forest.
- Furtheer enhance to **99% accuracy**.
